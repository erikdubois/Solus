Print Size

    i) Scaling Specification

        Specify the size ratio for enlargement or reduction as a % value. With the lpr command,
        you can use "natural-scaling," which is a standard option, to perform
        the Scaling Specification.
        For information about the options that can be set in the lpr command (CUPS),
        see the homepage for the Common UNIX Printing System (http://www.cups.org/).

    ii) Fit-to-Page Printing

        Syntax         : -o scaling=100

        This function expands or reduces the image to fit the print area, without changing
        the vertical-horizontal ratio. It scales the image to fit to the print area
        in either the horizontal or vertical direction.

        *Scaling Specification and Fit-to-Page Printing cannot be specified
        at the same time.

Print Position

    With the lpr command, you can use "position," which is a standard option, to perform
    the Print Position adjustment. For information about the options that can be set
    in the lpr command (CUPS), see the homepage for the Common UNIX Printing System
    (http://www.cups.org/).


Copies

    Syntax         :  -#[parameter]
    Parameter : 1 - 999 [Default Value=1]
